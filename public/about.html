            <h1>About StudAI Research Project</h1>
            <p>Welcome to this experimental platform exploring human-AI interaction.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>This is an open research experiment investigating the effects of an unrestricted acces to users to teaching an ai model.</p>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Research Objective</h2>
            <p>The project aims to answer:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"What would humanity teach an AI if there were no constraints?"</li>
                <li>Ethical considerations in open-ended AI training</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>How can I participate?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>You can talk freely with studAi without having to teach him anything. He just wants to have a chat sometimes :)</li>
                <li>You can teach him anything you want -from the most controversial opinion or false fact to the most valuable piece of information ever told-</li>
                <li>You can ask him different questions to test his knowledge</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Limitations</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Each session has a maximum of 10 messages. This is done for limiting the pressure over the database and the APIs</li>
                <li>Given the fact that the ai base model is an open-source model (llama-3.3-70b-versatile) it may sometimes behave in a unwanted way</li>
                <li>The web uses some API services for running - Expect possible downtimes</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
